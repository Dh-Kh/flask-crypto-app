# flask-crypto-app
## Project description
The main goal of this project was to create a Flask app that provides users with the ability to create their own wallet. The app allows users to perform transactions with other users within the app and provides the functionality to check crypto prices with scalable options. Additionally, the project includes the capability to retrieve TRX transactions and allows users to purchase my coins from Tron.
## Installation
Download flask-crypto app
```
pip install git+https://github.com/Dh-Kh/flask-crypto-app.git
```
P.S. For the app to work properly, you need to set up an .env file and define your own sensitive data, such as email credentials and secret keys.
